# odin-landing-page
Another Odin project. Been given design images to work towards

This was my first time building a landing page based on design images. I learnt alot but I'm definately still learning. 

In this project I used everything I had learned all at once, my first taste of the workflow. The main difference between this project and the last is my use of flexbox. I think in alot of cases I haved it unnecessarily, in the futute hope I will learn the proper use cases for it.

During my last assignment (see repo odin-recipes) i had trouble knowing what to name classes and IDs so after some research I found out about BEM. In this project I attenpted using this. I think I understand the reasoning behind it but I dont think i executed it that well, I'm definately not using it to its full extent. This could possible be due to the small size of the project as i believe BEM is meant for larger projects than this.
